# 1. Introduction 

R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. 

```{r}
# Simple Text no command
```

futher examples

```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
# 3 + 4
```


# 2. Arithmetic with R 

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^
Modulo: %%


The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.

```{r}
3^2
```

The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

```{r}
5%%3
```


# 3. Variable assignment

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

Example 

```{r}
my_var <- 4

```


Futher Examples

```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42 

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

the number 42, the valye of the x variable should be displayed

## Arithmetic with variables

```{r}
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit<- my_apples + my_oranges
```


# 4. Basic Data Types in R

R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

* Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
* Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
* Text (or string) values are called characters.

Important not to mix data types when doing commands

Example of how to check data classes

```{r}
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
```


# 5. Create a vector

Examples of different vectors- different lists of variables, discrete to their own data type:

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

The examples above show the concatenate tool


# 6. Naming a Vector


As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.

You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. 

Example

```{r}
some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
```

This code first creates a vector some_vector and then gives the two elements a name. The first element is assigned the name Name, while the second element is labeled Profession.


Can use expressions to generate Boolean Phrases

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette 
total_roulette
total_poker

total_poker > total_roulette
```



# 7. Vector Selection: selection with brackets


To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, ...), you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets, you indicate what elements to select. For example, to select the first element of the vector, you type poker_vector[1]. To select the second element of the vector, you type poker_vector[2], etc. Notice that the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages.


```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]

```


To select multiple elements from a vector, you can add square brackets at the end of it. You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected. For example: suppose you want to select the first and the fifth day of the week: use the vector c(1, 5) between the square brackets. For example, the code below selects the first and fifth element of poker_vector:

```{r}
poker_vector[c(1, 5)]

```

Futher example from the poker problem:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2,3,5)]

print(poker_midweek)

```

midweek poker to select continious elements from the list:

c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to2:4, which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.

So, another way to find the mid-week results is poker_vector[2:4]. Notice how the vector 2:4 is placed between the square brackets to select element 2 up to 4.

Further example from the poker and roulette examples:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[2:5]

roulette_selection_vector
```


# 8. Selection by Comparison
* Step 1 - Selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself

By making use of comparison operators, we can approach the previous question in a more proactive way.

The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:

< for less than
> for greater than
<= for less than or equal to
>= for greater than or equal to
== for equal to each other
!= not equal to each other

```{r}
# Results should respond with "TRUE"
6 > 5 
```

Can apply comparisons agruments to variables inside a list

```{r}
 c(4, 5, 6) > 5
# [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE
```


Example of arithmetic and comparison agruments:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- (poker_vector>0)
  
# Print out selection_vector
selection_vector
```


Example below is for creating a vector to be used for further selection:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- (poker_vector > 0)
selection_vector

# Select from poker_vector these days
poker_winning_days <- (poker_vector[selection_vector])
poker_winning_days
```


# 9. Matrix - what is a matrix?

n R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.

You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:

```{r}
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
```

In the matrix() function:

The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix. Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.


## 9.1 Analyze Matrices

example problem description:
Construct a matrix with 3 rows, where each row represents a movie. Use the matrix() function to do this. The first argument is the vector box_office, containing all box office figures. Next, you'll have to specify nrow = 3 and byrow = TRUE. Name the resulting matrix star_wars_matrix.

```{r}
# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, byrow= TRUE, nrow = 3)

star_wars_matrix

```


## 9.2 Naming a Matrix
Similar to vectors, you can add names for the rows and the columns of a matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector

can apply arithmetic to the matrices

```{r}
# Construct star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                           dimnames = list(c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi"), 
                                           c("US", "non-US")))

# Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)

# > worldwide_vector
#              A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back      Return of the Jedi 
#                 775.398                 538.375                 475.106

worldwide_vector
```

## 9.3 Adding a Column

You can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function

Example of adding columns with the column bind function:

```{r}
# Construct star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                           dimnames = list(c("A New Hope", 
                                             "The Empire Strikes Back", 
                                             "Return of the Jedi"), 
                                           c("US", "non-US")))

# The worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)

# Bind the new variable worldwide_vector as a column to star_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix <- cbind(worldwide_vector, star_wars_matrix)

all_wars_matrix

#Results
#                         worldwide_vector      US non-US
# A New Hope                       775.398 460.998  314.4
# The Empire Strikes Back          538.375 290.475  247.9
# Return of the Jedi               475.106 309.306  165.8


```


## 9.4 Adding a Row


1. Function to review cbind()
Usage
cbind(..., deparse.level = 1)

      

2. New function - rbind() ~ similarly used to the previous function to add rows
Usage
rbind(..., deparse.level = 1)
    S3 method for class 'data.frame'
rbind(..., deparse.level = 1, make.row.names = TRUE,
      stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors(), factor.exclude = NA)


ls() is the "list objects" function

Usage
ls(name, pos = -1L, envir = as.environment(pos),
   all.names = FALSE, pattern, sorted = TRUE)
objects(name, pos= -1L, envir = as.environment(pos),
        all.names = FALSE, pattern, sorted = TRUE)


## 9.5 Arithmetic and Columns in Matrices

Review of functions used: cbind() & rbind()
Both have related computational functions, colSums() has rowSums().

example: 


```{r}
# all_wars_matrix is available in your workspace
all_wars_matrix
#                            US non-US
# A New Hope              461.0  314.4
# The Empire Strikes Back 290.5  247.9
# Return of the Jedi      309.3  165.8
# The Phantom Menace      474.5  552.5
# Attack of the Clones    310.7  338.7
# Revenge of the Sith     380.3  468.5

# Total revenue for US and non-US
total_revenue_vector <- colSums(all_wars_matrix)
 
# Print out total_revenue_vector
# total_revenue_vector
#     US non-US 
# 2226.3 2087.8
```


## 9.6 Selection of Matrix Elements

```{r}
# all_wars_matrix and ticket_prices_matrix are available in your workspace
all_wars_matrix
ticket_prices_matrix

# Estimated number of visitors
visitors <- all_wars_matrix / ticket_prices_matrix
visitors

# US visitors
us_visitors <- visitors[,1]
us_visitors

# Average number of US visitors
mean(us_visitors)
```

notice the selection by what was determined in brackets
the more correct expression for multiplication is % * % 


# 10. Factors - what are they and when you should use them? 

The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.

Continuous & Categorical

It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable

Categorical variable example : sex

Continuous variable example: temperature (demicals)


To create factors in R, you make use of the function factor(). First thing that you have to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a limited number of categories. 


```{r}
## Code
# Sex vector
sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")

# Convert sex_vector to a factor
factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

# Print out factor_sex_vector
factor_sex_vector

## Results
# # Sex vector
# > sex_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")
# > 
# > # Convert sex_vector to a factor
# > factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)
# > 
# > # Print out factor_sex_vector
# > factor_sex_vector
# [1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
# Levels: Female Male
# > 

```


## 10.1 Factors - Types of Categorical Variables (2)
1. Nominal (1 of 2)
2. Ordinal (2 of 2)


A nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order. This means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'. 

For example, think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories 
"Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey" and "Horse"

In contrast, ordinal variables do have a natural ordering. Consider for example the categorical variable temperature_vector with the categories: "Low", "Medium" and "High". Here it is obvious that "Medium" stands above "Low", and "High" stands above "Medium".

## 10.2 Factor Levels


Factors often contain variables with specific factor levels. 
However, sometimes you will want to change the names of these levels for clarity or other reasons. R allows you to do this with the function levels():

```{r}
levels(factor_vector) <- c("name1", "name2",...)
```

Example
```{r}
# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)

# Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

factor_survey_vector

#Console view- Results
# > # Code to build factor_survey_vector
# > survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
# > factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
# > 
# > # Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
# > levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
# > 
# > factor_survey_vector
# [1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
# Levels: Female Male

```


## 10.2 Summarizing a factor

function to summarize a factor (among other things- will detail if a character or mode, etc)

summmary()


example

```{r}
# Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

# Generate summary for survey_vector
summary(survey_vector)

# Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
summary(factor_survey_vector)


## Results- Console View

# > # Build factor_survey_vector with clean levels
# > survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
# > factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
# > levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
# > factor_survey_vector
# [1] Male   Female Female Male   Male  
# Levels: Female Male
# > 
# > # Generate summary for survey_vector
# > summary(survey_vector)
#    Length     Class      Mode 
#         5 character character
# > 
# > # Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
# > summary(factor_survey_vector)
# Female   Male 
#      2      3

```


## 10.3 Ordered Factors

Ordering factors will involve converting a nomial factor to an ordinal factor
"Male" and "Female" are examples of unordered (or nominal) factor levels

R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors

example:

```{r}
# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")

## Results - Console View
# > speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")
# > speed_vector
# [1] "medium" "slow"   "slow"   "medium" "fast"

```


converting a nomial factor to an ordinal factor

To create an ordered factor, you have to add two additional arguments: ordered and levels.

factor(some_vector,
       ordered = TRUE,
       levels = c("lev1", "lev2" ...))
       
By setting the argument ordered to TRUE in the function factor(), you indicate that the factor is ordered. With the argument levels you give the values of the factor in the correct order.

Example
```{r}
# Create speed_vector
speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")

# Convert speed_vector to ordered factor vector
factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector,
                              ordered = TRUE,
                              levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))

# Print factor_speed_vector
factor_speed_vector
summary(factor_speed_vector)


#Results- Console View

# > # Create speed_vector
# > speed_vector <- c("medium", "slow", "slow", "medium", "fast")
# > 
# > # Convert speed_vector to ordered factor vector
# > factor_speed_vector <- factor(speed_vector,
#                                 ordered = TRUE,
#                                 levels = c("slow", "medium", "fast"))
# > 
# > # Print factor_speed_vector
# > factor_speed_vector
# [1] medium slow   slow   medium fast  
# Levels: slow < medium < fast
# > summary(factor_speed_vector)
#   slow medium   fast 
#      2      2      1
