# 1. Introduction 

R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. 

```{r}
# Simple Text no command
```

futher examples

```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
# 3 + 4
```


# 2. Arithmetic with R 

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^
Modulo: %%


The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.

```{r}
3^2
```

The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

```{r}
5%%3
```


# 3. Variable assignment

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

Example 

```{r}
my_var <- 4

```


Futher Examples

```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42 

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

the number 42, the valye of the x variable should be displayed

## Arithmetic with variables

```{r}
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit<- my_apples + my_oranges
```


# 4. Basic Data Types in R

R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

* Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
* Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
* Text (or string) values are called characters.

Important not to mix data types when doing commands

Example of how to check data classes

```{r}
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
```


# 5. Create a vector

Examples of different vectors- different lists of variables, discrete to their own data type:

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

The examples above show the concatenate tool


# 6. Naming a Vector


As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.

You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. 

Example

```{r}
some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
```

This code first creates a vector some_vector and then gives the two elements a name. The first element is assigned the name Name, while the second element is labeled Profession.


Can use expressions to generate Boolean Phrases

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette 
total_roulette
total_poker

total_poker > total_roulette
```



# 7. Vector Selection: selection with brackets


To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, ...), you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets, you indicate what elements to select. For example, to select the first element of the vector, you type poker_vector[1]. To select the second element of the vector, you type poker_vector[2], etc. Notice that the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages.


```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]

```


To select multiple elements from a vector, you can add square brackets at the end of it. You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected. For example: suppose you want to select the first and the fifth day of the week: use the vector c(1, 5) between the square brackets. For example, the code below selects the first and fifth element of poker_vector:

```{r}
poker_vector[c(1, 5)]

```

Futher example from the poker problem:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2,3,5)]

print(poker_midweek)

```

midweek poker to select continious elements from the list:

c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to2:4, which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.

So, another way to find the mid-week results is poker_vector[2:4]. Notice how the vector 2:4 is placed between the square brackets to select element 2 up to 4.

Further example from the poker and roulette examples:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[2:5]

roulette_selection_vector
```


# 8. Selection by Comparison
* Step 1 - Selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself

By making use of comparison operators, we can approach the previous question in a more proactive way.

The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:

< for less than
> for greater than
<= for less than or equal to
>= for greater than or equal to
== for equal to each other
!= not equal to each other

```{r}
# Results should respond with "TRUE"
6 > 5 
```

Can apply comparisons agruments to variables inside a list

```{r}
 c(4, 5, 6) > 5
# [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE
```


Example of arithmetic and comparison agruments:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- (poker_vector>0)
  
# Print out selection_vector
selection_vector
```


Example below is for creating a vector to be used for further selection:

```{r}
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- (poker_vector > 0)
selection_vector

# Select from poker_vector these days
poker_winning_days <- (poker_vector[selection_vector])
poker_winning_days
```


# 9. Matrix - what is a matrix?

n R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.

You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:

```{r}
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
```

In the matrix() function:

The first argument is the collection of elements that R will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix. Here, we use 1:9 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.
The third argument nrow indicates that the matrix should have three rows.


## 9.1 Analyze Matrices

example problem description:
Construct a matrix with 3 rows, where each row represents a movie. Use the matrix() function to do this. The first argument is the vector box_office, containing all box office figures. Next, you'll have to specify nrow = 3 and byrow = TRUE. Name the resulting matrix star_wars_matrix.

```{r}
# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, byrow= TRUE, nrow = 3)

star_wars_matrix

```


## 9.2 Naming a Matrix
Similar to vectors, you can add names for the rows and the columns of a matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector

can apply arithmetic to the matrices

```{r}
# Construct star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                           dimnames = list(c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi"), 
                                           c("US", "non-US")))

# Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)

# > worldwide_vector
#              A New Hope The Empire Strikes Back      Return of the Jedi 
#                 775.398                 538.375                 475.106

worldwide_vector
```

You can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the cbind() function

Example of adding columns with the column bind function:

```{r}
# Construct star_wars_matrix
box_office <- c(460.998, 314.4, 290.475, 247.900, 309.306, 165.8)
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                           dimnames = list(c("A New Hope", 
                                             "The Empire Strikes Back", 
                                             "Return of the Jedi"), 
                                           c("US", "non-US")))

# The worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)

# Bind the new variable worldwide_vector as a column to star_wars_matrix
all_wars_matrix <- cbind(worldwide_vector, star_wars_matrix)

all_wars_matrix

#Results
#                         worldwide_vector      US non-US
# A New Hope                       775.398 460.998  314.4
# The Empire Strikes Back          538.375 290.475  247.9
# Return of the Jedi               475.106 309.306  165.8
