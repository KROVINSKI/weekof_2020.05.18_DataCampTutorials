# 1. Introduction 

R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. 

```{r}
# Simple Text no command
```

futher examples

```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
# 3 + 4
```


# 2. Arithmetic with R 

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Exponentiation: ^
Modulo: %%


The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.

```{r}
3^2
```

The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.

```{r}
5%%3
```


# 3. Variable assignment

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

Example 

```{r}
my_var <- 4

```


Futher Examples

```{r}
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42 

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

the number 42, the valye of the x variable should be displayed

## Arithmetic with variables

```{r}
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6

# Add these two variables together
my_apples + my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit<- my_apples + my_oranges
```


# 4. Basic Data Types in R

R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

* Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
* Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
* Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
* Text (or string) values are called characters.

Important not to mix data types when doing commands

Example of how to check data classes

```{r}
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
```










Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
