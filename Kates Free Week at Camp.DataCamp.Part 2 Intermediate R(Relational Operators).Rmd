# 1. Equality
The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE.

Example: 

```{r}
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

```

Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r".

## 1.1 Instructions

```{r}
## Instructions
# In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
# Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
# Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
# Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?
```

## 1.1a User Input 

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE = FALSE
TRUE != FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
(-6 * 14)
(17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" = "user"

# # Console Results
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > # Comparison of logicals
# > TRUE = FALSE
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > TRUE != FALSE
# [1] TRUE
# > 
# > # Comparison of numerics
# > (-6 * 14)
# [1] -84
# > (17 - 101)
# [1] -84
# > (-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
# [1] FALSE
# > (-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)
# Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
# > 
# > # Comparison of character strings
# > "useR" = "user"
# > 
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

```

## 1.1b Final Solution

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```

Note the use of the double equal sign

Since TRUE coerces to 1 under the hood, 
TRUE == 1 evaluates to TRUE. 
Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) and = (assignment), == is what need to check the equality of R objects.



# 2. Greater and less than

less than and greater than operators: < and >. 
You can also add an equal sign to express less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively. 
Have a look at the following R expressions, that all evaluate to FALSE:

```{r}
(1 + 2) > 4
"dog" < "Cats"
TRUE <= FALSE
```

R determines the greater than relationship based on alphabetical order. 

TRUE is treated as 1 for arithmetic, and FALSE is treated as 0. Therefore, FALSE < TRUE is TRUE.




# 3. Compare vectors & Compare matrices
R's relational operators also work on vectors.


R's ability to deal with different data structures for comparisons does not stop at vectors. Matrices and relational operators also work together seamlessly


# 4. Logical Operators

When the abersand is used twice for some reason it only reads the first element

## 4.1 & and |    

Example
```{r}

TRUE & TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
3 < 4 | 7 < 6

# Console Results
# > TRUE & TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > FALSE | TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > 5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
# [1] TRUE
# > 3 < 4 | 7 < 6
# [1] TRUE

```


Like relational operators, logical operators work perfectly fine with vectors and matrices.


# 5. Reverse the result: !


On top of the & and | operators, you also learned about the ! operator, which negates a logical value. To refresh your memory, here are some R expressions that use !. They all evaluate to FALSE:

Example

```{r}
!TRUE
!(5 > 3)
!!FALSE
```























This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
