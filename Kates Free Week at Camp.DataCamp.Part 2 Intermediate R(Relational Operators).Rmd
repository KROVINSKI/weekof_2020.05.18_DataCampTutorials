# 1. Equality
The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE.

Example: 

```{r}
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

```

Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r".

## 1.1 Instructions

```{r}
## Instructions
# In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
# Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
# Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
# Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?
```

## 1.1a User Input 

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE = FALSE
TRUE != FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
(-6 * 14)
(17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" = "user"

# # Console Results
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > # Comparison of logicals
# > TRUE = FALSE
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > TRUE != FALSE
# [1] TRUE
# > 
# > # Comparison of numerics
# > (-6 * 14)
# [1] -84
# > (17 - 101)
# [1] -84
# > (-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
# [1] FALSE
# > (-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)
# Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
# > 
# > # Comparison of character strings
# > "useR" = "user"
# > 
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

```

## 1.1b Final Solution

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```

Note the use of the double equal sign

Since TRUE coerces to 1 under the hood, 
TRUE == 1 evaluates to TRUE. 
Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) and = (assignment), == is what need to check the equality of R objects.



# 2. Greater and less than

less than and greater than operators: < and >. 
You can also add an equal sign to express less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively. 
Have a look at the following R expressions, that all evaluate to FALSE:

```{r}
(1 + 2) > 4
"dog" < "Cats"
TRUE <= FALSE
```

R determines the greater than relationship based on alphabetical order. 

TRUE is treated as 1 for arithmetic, and FALSE is treated as 0. Therefore, FALSE < TRUE is TRUE.




# 3. Compare vectors & Compare matrices
R's relational operators also work on vectors.


R's ability to deal with different data structures for comparisons does not stop at vectors. Matrices and relational operators also work together seamlessly


# 4. Logical Operators


![Figure 1 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/Andoperator.png)


![Figure 2 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/Andoperator2.png)


![Figure 1 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ORoperator.png)

![Figure 2 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ORoperator2.png)


When the abersand is used twice for some reason it only reads the first element

![Figure 3 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/andand.png)

![Figure 3 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/oror.png)

## 4.1 & and |    

Example
```{r}

TRUE & TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
3 < 4 | 7 < 6

# Console Results
# > TRUE & TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > FALSE | TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > 5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
# [1] TRUE
# > 3 < 4 | 7 < 6
# [1] TRUE

```


Like relational operators, logical operators work perfectly fine with vectors and matrices.


# 5. Reverse the result: !


On top of the & and | operators, you also learned about the ! operator, which negates a logical value. To refresh your memory, here are some R expressions that use !. They all evaluate to FALSE:

Example

```{r}
!TRUE
!(5 > 3)
!!FALSE
```



# 6. Conditional Statements


if statement can be on it's own 
whereas 
the else statement needs an if conditional statement


Figures with If, IF Else statements with results 

![Figure of the "IF" Statement](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ifstatement.png)

![Figure of the "IF" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ifstatement_results.png)


![Figure of the "Else" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/elsestatement.png)


![Figure of the "ELSE IF" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/elseifstatement.png)

## 6.1 Condition Statement "IF" Syntax

Review of if statement syntax:
```{r}

if (condition)
  expr

```

## 6.2 Condition Statement "ELSE" Syntax
You can only use an else statement in combination with an if statement.

The else statement does not require a condition; its corresponding code is simply run if all of the preceding conditions in the control structure are FALSE. 
else syntax:

```{r}
if (condition) {
  expr1
} else {
  expr2
}
```

Else Statements examples: 

```{r}
if (number < 10) {
  if (number < 5) {
    result <- "extra small"
  } else {
    result <- "small"
  }
} else if (number < 100) {
  result <- "medium"
} else {
  result <- "large"
}
print(result)
```

Have a look at the following statements:

If number is set to 6, "small" gets printed to the console. CORRECT
If number is set to 100, R prints out "medium". INCORRECT
If number is set to 4, "extra small" gets printed out to the console. CORRECT
If number is set to 2500, R will generate an error, as result will not be defined. INCORRECT

# 7. While Loop

the while loop does not stop
wants to go over and over again

asside- ctr is a counter expression 


![Figure of the "while loop" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloop1.png)



![Figure of the "while loop" counting to 7 Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloopto8.png)


![Figure of the "while loop" counting Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloopat8.png)


have to give your while loop a place to stop



![Figure of the "while loop" counting Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/breakstatement.png)



Example of while loop:
```{r}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 64

# Code the while loop
while (speed > 30) {
  print("Slow down!")
  speed <- speed - 7
}

# Print out the speed variable
speed
```

Example of giving a break statement for the loop:

```{r}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 88

while (speed > 30) {
  print(paste("Your speed is", speed))
  
  # Break the while loop when speed exceeds 80
  if (speed > 80) {
    break
  }
  
  if (speed > 48) {
    print("Slow down big time!")
    speed <- speed - 11
  } else {
    print("Slow down!")
    speed <- speed - 6
  }
}
```



# 8. For Loop



![Figure of a "for loop" example](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloop.png)


![Figure of a "for loop" example with results](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloop2.png)



![Figure of a "for loop" over a list example](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/loopoverlist.png)

## 8.1 For Loop Control Statements

control statements are still important 
break
next 


nchar - Count the Number of Characters (or Bytes or Width)

```{r}
nchar
```


Description
nchar takes a character vector as an argument and returns a vector whose elements contain the sizes of the corresponding elements of x. Internally, it is a generic, for which methods can be defined.

nzchar is a fast way to find out if elements of a character vector are non-empty strings.

![Figure of a "for loop" over a list with a next statement](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/nextstatementforloop.png)


## 8.2 For Loop "Index"

Can loop based on the length of the items in a list


![Figure of a "for loop" by the length of the list](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/looplistv2.png)

![Figure of a "for loop" by the length of the list- index set](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/looplistbylengthofindex.png)

You now gain positional information

## 8.3 Looping over a list

Looping over a list- same as looping over a vector

two different avenues:

```{r}
primes_list <- list(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# loop version 1
for (p in primes_list) {
  print(p)
}

# loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(primes_list)) {
  print(primes_list[[i]])
}
```


Example with NYC data:

```{r}
# The nyc list is already specified
nyc <- list(pop = 8405837, 
            boroughs = c("Manhattan", "Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Queens", "Staten Island"), 
            capital = FALSE)

# Loop version 1
for (info in nyc) {
  print(info)
}

# Loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(nyc)) {
  print(nyc[[i]])
}
```

Results

```{r}
# > # The nyc list is already specified
# > nyc <- list(pop = 8405837, 
#               boroughs = c("Manhattan", "Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Queens", "Staten Island"), 
#               capital = FALSE)
# > 
# > # Loop version 1
# > for (info in nyc) {
#     print(info)
#   }
# [1] 8405837
# [1] "Manhattan"     "Bronx"         "Brooklyn"      "Queens"       
# [5] "Staten Island"
# [1] FALSE
# > 
# > # Loop version 2
# > for (i in 1:length(nyc)) {
#     print(nyc[[i]])
#   }
# [1] 8405837
# [1] "Manhattan"     "Bronx"         "Brooklyn"      "Queens"       
# [5] "Staten Island"
# [1] FALSE
```


## 8.4 Looping over a matrix

Loop over a matrix

Basic set up to loop over a matrix
```{r}
for (var1 in seq1) {
  for (var2 in seq2) {
    expr
  }
}
```
