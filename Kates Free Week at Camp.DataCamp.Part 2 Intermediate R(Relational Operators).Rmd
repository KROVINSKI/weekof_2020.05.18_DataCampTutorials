# 1. Equality
The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE.

Example: 

```{r}
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

```

Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r".

## 1.1 Instructions

```{r}
## Instructions
# In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
# Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
# Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
# Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?
```

## 1.1a User Input 

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE = FALSE
TRUE != FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
(-6 * 14)
(17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" = "user"

# # Console Results
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > # Comparison of logicals
# > TRUE = FALSE
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > TRUE != FALSE
# [1] TRUE
# > 
# > # Comparison of numerics
# > (-6 * 14)
# [1] -84
# > (17 - 101)
# [1] -84
# > (-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
# [1] FALSE
# > (-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)
# Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
# > 
# > # Comparison of character strings
# > "useR" = "user"
# > 
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

```

## 1.1b Final Solution

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```

Note the use of the double equal sign

Since TRUE coerces to 1 under the hood, 
TRUE == 1 evaluates to TRUE. 
Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) and = (assignment), == is what need to check the equality of R objects.



# 2. Greater and less than

less than and greater than operators: < and >. 
You can also add an equal sign to express less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively. 
Have a look at the following R expressions, that all evaluate to FALSE:

```{r}
(1 + 2) > 4
"dog" < "Cats"
TRUE <= FALSE
```

R determines the greater than relationship based on alphabetical order. 

TRUE is treated as 1 for arithmetic, and FALSE is treated as 0. Therefore, FALSE < TRUE is TRUE.




# 3. Compare vectors & Compare matrices
R's relational operators also work on vectors.


R's ability to deal with different data structures for comparisons does not stop at vectors. Matrices and relational operators also work together seamlessly


# 4. Logical Operators


![Figure 1 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/Andoperator.png)


![Figure 2 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/Andoperator2.png)


![Figure 1 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ORoperator.png)

![Figure 2 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ORoperator2.png)


When the abersand is used twice for some reason it only reads the first element

![Figure 3 of the "And" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/andand.png)

![Figure 3 of the "OR" Operator](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/oror.png)

## 4.1 & and |    

Example
```{r}

TRUE & TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
3 < 4 | 7 < 6

# Console Results
# > TRUE & TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > FALSE | TRUE
# [1] TRUE
# > 5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
# [1] TRUE
# > 3 < 4 | 7 < 6
# [1] TRUE

```


Like relational operators, logical operators work perfectly fine with vectors and matrices.


# 5. Reverse the result: !


On top of the & and | operators, you also learned about the ! operator, which negates a logical value. To refresh your memory, here are some R expressions that use !. They all evaluate to FALSE:

Example

```{r}
!TRUE
!(5 > 3)
!!FALSE
```



# 6. Conditional Statements


if statement can be on it's own 
whereas 
the else statement needs an if conditional statement


Figures with If, IF Else statements with results 

![Figure of the "IF" Statement](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ifstatement.png)

![Figure of the "IF" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/ifstatement_results.png)


![Figure of the "Else" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/elsestatement.png)


![Figure of the "ELSE IF" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/elseifstatement.png)

## 6.1 Condition Statement "IF" Syntax

Review of if statement syntax:
```{r}

if (condition)
  expr

```

## 6.2 Condition Statement "ELSE" Syntax
You can only use an else statement in combination with an if statement.

The else statement does not require a condition; its corresponding code is simply run if all of the preceding conditions in the control structure are FALSE. 
else syntax:

```{r}
if (condition) {
  expr1
} else {
  expr2
}
```

Else Statements examples: 

```{r}
if (number < 10) {
  if (number < 5) {
    result <- "extra small"
  } else {
    result <- "small"
  }
} else if (number < 100) {
  result <- "medium"
} else {
  result <- "large"
}
print(result)
```

Have a look at the following statements:

If number is set to 6, "small" gets printed to the console. CORRECT
If number is set to 100, R prints out "medium". INCORRECT
If number is set to 4, "extra small" gets printed out to the console. CORRECT
If number is set to 2500, R will generate an error, as result will not be defined. INCORRECT

# 7. While Loop

the while loop does not stop
wants to go over and over again

asside- ctr is a counter expression 


![Figure of the "while loop" Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloop1.png)



![Figure of the "while loop" counting to 7 Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloopto8.png)


![Figure of the "while loop" counting Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/whileloopat8.png)


have to give your while loop a place to stop



![Figure of the "while loop" counting Statement Results ](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/breakstatement.png)



Example of while loop:
```{r}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 64

# Code the while loop
while (speed > 30) {
  print("Slow down!")
  speed <- speed - 7
}

# Print out the speed variable
speed
```

Example of giving a break statement for the loop:

```{r}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 88

while (speed > 30) {
  print(paste("Your speed is", speed))
  
  # Break the while loop when speed exceeds 80
  if (speed > 80) {
    break
  }
  
  if (speed > 48) {
    print("Slow down big time!")
    speed <- speed - 11
  } else {
    print("Slow down!")
    speed <- speed - 6
  }
}
```



# 8. For Loop



![Figure of a "for loop" example](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloop.png)


![Figure of a "for loop" example with results](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloop2.png)



![Figure of a "for loop" over a list example](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/loopoverlist.png)

## 8.1 For Loop Control Statements

control statements are still important 
break
next 


nchar - Count the Number of Characters (or Bytes or Width)

```{r}
nchar
```


Description
nchar takes a character vector as an argument and returns a vector whose elements contain the sizes of the corresponding elements of x. Internally, it is a generic, for which methods can be defined.

nzchar is a fast way to find out if elements of a character vector are non-empty strings.


![Figure of a "for loop" over a list with a break statement](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloopbreakstatement.png)



![Figure of a "for loop" over a list with a next statement](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/nextstatementforloop.png)


## 8.2 For Loop "Index"

Can loop based on the length of the items in a list


![Figure of a "for loop" by the length of the list](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/looplistv2.png)

![Figure of a "for loop" by the length of the list- index set](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/looplistbylengthofindex.png)

You now gain positional information 


![Figure of a "for loop" by the length of the list- index set](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/forloopindexpositionalinformation.png)

## 8.3 Looping over a list

Looping over a list- same as looping over a vector

two different avenues:

```{r}
primes_list <- list(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# loop version 1
for (p in primes_list) {
  print(p)
}

# loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(primes_list)) {
  print(primes_list[[i]])
}
```


Example with NYC data:

```{r}
# The nyc list is already specified
nyc <- list(pop = 8405837, 
            boroughs = c("Manhattan", "Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Queens", "Staten Island"), 
            capital = FALSE)

# Loop version 1
for (info in nyc) {
  print(info)
}

# Loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(nyc)) {
  print(nyc[[i]])
}
```

Results

```{r}
# > # The nyc list is already specified
# > nyc <- list(pop = 8405837, 
#               boroughs = c("Manhattan", "Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Queens", "Staten Island"), 
#               capital = FALSE)
# > 
# > # Loop version 1
# > for (info in nyc) {
#     print(info)
#   }
# [1] 8405837
# [1] "Manhattan"     "Bronx"         "Brooklyn"      "Queens"       
# [5] "Staten Island"
# [1] FALSE
# > 
# > # Loop version 2
# > for (i in 1:length(nyc)) {
#     print(nyc[[i]])
#   }
# [1] 8405837
# [1] "Manhattan"     "Bronx"         "Brooklyn"      "Queens"       
# [5] "Staten Island"
# [1] FALSE
```


## 8.4 Looping over a matrix

Loop over a matrix

Basic set up to loop over a matrix
```{r}
for (var1 in seq1) {
  for (var2 in seq2) {
    expr
  }
}
```


# 9. Functions 


## 9.1 Understanding functions

![Function - NA values](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/functions_NAvalues.png)

Rather than use the ? or fn with f1 button you can use the args function to query the syntax of another function

![Function - fast way to query a function](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/function_args.png)


# 10. Writing Your own  Function


function template:

```{r}
my_fun <- function(arg1, arg2) {
  body
}
```


Example of random results (throwing dice)

```{r}
throw_die <- function() {
  number <- sample(1:6, size = 1)
  number
}

throw_die()
```

Example of creating a greeting function, saying hello 

```{r}
# Define the function hello()
hello <- function() {
  print("Hi there!")
  TRUE
}

# Call the function hello()
hello()
```


You can define default argument values in your own R functions

```{r}
my_fun <- function(arg1, arg2 = val2) {
  body
}
```


# 11. R Packages 

Load an R Package
There are basically two extremely important functions when it comes down to R packages:

install.packages(), which as you can expect, installs a given package.
library() which loads packages, i.e. attaches them to the search list on your R workspace.

To install packages, you need administrator privileges. This means that install.packages() will thus not work in the DataCamp interface. However, almost all CRAN packages are installed on our servers. You can load them with library().


# 12. Lapply


The Usage section shows the following expression:

```{r}
lapply(X, FUN, ...)
```



The triple() function was transformed to the multiply() function to allow for a more generic approach. lapply() provides a way to handle functions that require more than one argument, such as the multiply() function:

```{r}
multiply <- function(x, factor) {
  x * factor
}
lapply(list(1,2,3), multiply, factor = 3)
```


Apply functions that return NULL

the tolower() function simply returns the strings with the characters in lowercase. This won't always be the case. Suppose you want to display the structure of every element of a list. You could use the str() function for this, which returns NULL:

```{r}
lapply(list(1, "a", TRUE), str)
```

This call actually returns a list, the same size as the input list, containing all NULL values. On the other hand calling

```{r}
str(TRUE)
```


on its own prints only the structure of the logical to the console, not NULL. That's because str() uses invisible() behind the scenes, which returns an invisible copy of the return value, NULL in this case. This prevents it from being printed when the result of str() is not assigned.

# 13. sapply

You can use sapply() similar to how you used lapply(). The first argument of sapply() is the list or vector X over which you want to apply a function, FUN. Potential additional arguments to this function are specified afterwards (...):

```{r}
sapply(X, FUN, ...)
```


Apply a Function over a List or Vector
Description
lapply returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.

sapply is a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array if appropriate, by applying simplify2array(). sapply(x, f, simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE) is the same as lapply(x, f).

# 14. vapply

The function is called vapply(), and it has the following syntax:

vapply(X, FUN, FUN.VALUE, ..., USE.NAMES = TRUE)

vapply is similar to sapply, but has a pre-specified type of return value, so it can be safer (and sometimes faster) to use.


# 15. Useful Functions

## 15.1 Mathematical utilities
Have another look at some useful math functions that R features:

abs(): Calculate the absolute value.
sum(): Calculate the sum of all the values in a data structure.
mean(): Calculate the arithmetic mean.
round(): Round the values to 0 decimal places by default. Try out ?round in the console for variations of round() and ways to change the number of digits to round to.

## 15.2 Find the Error
In times of despair, help with functions such as sum() and rev() are a single command away; simply use ?sum and ?rev in the console.

Example:
```{r}
# > # Don't edit these two lines
vec1 <- c(1.5, 2.5, 8.4, 3.7, 6.3)
 vec2 <- rev(vec1)
# > 
# > # Fix the error
# > mean(abs(vec1), abs(vec2))
# Error: 'trim' must be numeric of length one

## Console Result/Solution
# # Don't edit these two lines
# vec1 <- c(1.5, 2.5, 8.4, 3.7, 6.3)
# vec2 <- rev(vec1)
# 
# # Fix the error
# mean(c(abs(vec1), abs(vec2)))

```


## 15.3 Data Utilities

R features a bunch of functions to juggle around with data structures::

seq(): Generate sequences, by specifying the from, to, and by arguments.
rep(): Replicate elements of vectors and lists.
sort(): Sort a vector in ascending order. Works on numerics, but also on character strings and logicals.
rev(): Reverse the elements in a data structures for which reversal is defined.
str(): Display the structure of any R object.
append(): Merge vectors or lists.
is.*(): Check for the class of an R object.
as.*(): Convert an R object from one class to another.
unlist(): Flatten (possibly embedded) lists to produce a vector.


# 16. Regular Expressions 




![Fun List of Regular Expressions](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/weekof_2020.05.18_DataCampTutorials/regularexpressions1.png)


grepl & grep
In their most basic form, regular expressions can be used to see whether a pattern exists inside a character string or a vector of character strings. For this purpose, you can use:

grepl(), which returns TRUE when a pattern is found in the corresponding character string.
grep(), which returns a vector of indices of the character strings that contains the pattern.


Both functions need a pattern and an x argument, where pattern is the regular expression you want to match for, and the x argument is the character vector from which matches should be sought.
