# 1. Equality
The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let's briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE.

Example: 

```{r}
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
TRUE != FALSE
"Rchitect" != "rchitect"

```

Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: "R" is not equal to "r".

## 1.1 Instructions

```{r}
## Instructions
# In the editor on the right, write R code to see if TRUE equals FALSE.
# Likewise, check if -6 * 14 is not equal to 17 - 101.
# Next up: comparison of character strings. Ask R whether the strings "useR" and "user" are equal.
# Finally, find out what happens if you compare logicals to numerics: are TRUE and 1 equal?
```

## 1.1a User Input 

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE = FALSE
TRUE != FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
(-6 * 14)
(17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
(-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" = "user"

# # Console Results
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > # Comparison of logicals
# > TRUE = FALSE
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
# > TRUE != FALSE
# [1] TRUE
# > 
# > # Comparison of numerics
# > (-6 * 14)
# [1] -84
# > (17 - 101)
# [1] -84
# > (-6 * 14) != (17 - 101)
# [1] FALSE
# > (-6 * 14) = (17 - 101)
# Error: target of assignment expands to non-language object
# > 
# > # Comparison of character strings
# > "useR" = "user"
# > 
# > # Compare a logical with a numeric
# > TRUE = 1
# Error: invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

```

## 1.1b Final Solution

```{r}
# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1
```

Note the use of the double equal sign

Since TRUE coerces to 1 under the hood, 
TRUE == 1 evaluates to TRUE. 
Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) and = (assignment), == is what need to check the equality of R objects.



# 2. Greater and less than














 Keep this in mind when solving the exercises in this chapter!




















This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
